To celebrate early adopters of the Cashio Dollar, we’re introducing Cashio’s fair launch memecoin: Cash Cow ($COW).

Memecoins like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu have shown to be quite successful drivers of community engagement within the crypto ecosystem. We hope that Cash Cow can provide a similar level of organic growth of the Cashio community.

Cash Cow will be a completely fair launch. There will be no team or investor allocations; every $COW will be mined through $CASH-paired liquidity pools using Quarry Protocol as a way to incentivize $CASH adoption. If you’re an AMM that’s interested in working together on incentivizing $CASH through $COW, we’d love to chat!

> $COW has a hard cap of 100,000,000,000 tokens. We’ll be updating this page soon with details on liquidity mining incentives.
> Please note that Cash Cow ($COW) is not connected to our upcoming DAO governance token.
> We does not recommend purchasing $COW for speculative investment purposes. $COW tokens may lose value or have no value and may have no market.
